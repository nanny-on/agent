the same thing or there may be reasons why that feature isn't implemented.

Coding Style
------------

We know that coding sytle is very personal. However, an open source project is likely to have a variety of members and contributors.
To make sure effective communication between them, we hopefully recommend to comply with [Linux kernel coding style].

For Testing and Development
---------------------------

Although testing and development could in theory also be done using
the source tarballs, having a local copy of the git repository with
the entire project history gives you much more insight into the
code base.

The official Nanny-On Git Repository is located at [github.com/nanny-on/agent].
 
 [github.com/nanny-on/agent]: <https://github.com/nanny-on/agent>

A local copy of the Git Repository can be obtained by cloning it from
the original Nanny-On repository using

    git clone git://github.com/nanny-on/agent.git

If you intend to contribute to Nanny-On project, either to fix bugs or contribute
new features, you need to fork the Nanny-On repository nanny-on/agent on
GitHub and clone your public fork instead.
